# PokemonGoMap-Website
Upload a static website, so you can share your scanning session with others. They cannot move marker or start searches.

You need to have a running PokemonGo-Map instance that is accessible from the web.

Users can't send any commands, they can just read what is being scanned, and stored gyms/stops/spawnpoint from the DB.

You need to change 3 files in order to make it work.
