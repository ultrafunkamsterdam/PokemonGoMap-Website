# PokemonGoMap-Website
Upload a static website, so you can share your scanning session with others. They cannot move marker or start searches.

You need to have a running PokemonGo-Map instance that is accessible from the web.

Users can't send any commands, they can just read what is being scanned, and stored gyms/stops/spawnpoint from the DB.

You need to change 3 files in order to make it work.

Open index.html, preferably in notepad++ (because of the line breaks and  UTF-8).
on line 38 and 40  -or if you don't know how to get there, just browse untill you see the text `/* ADD YOUR POKEMONGO-MAPS SERVER INSTANCE LINK HERE.)`

You will see 2 required fields to be filled.
After that, you can set your initial location and zoomlevel.

No support is given whatsoever :).
